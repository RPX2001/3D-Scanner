## Solidwork Design

The Solidwork design for our project, 3D Scanner is mainly comprised of 3 parts:

- Main Body
- Tray lid
- Rotatable table
- Connector part

Used platform: Solidworks

All the sub main parts of the design are designed so that they are moldable for the large scale producability and, for the ease of testing we decided for 3D printing the parts.
